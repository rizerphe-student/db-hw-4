History[edit] In 1952 a decision was made to use a former German armaments factory in Jelcz-Laskowice near Wrocław for production in western Poland. A company called Zakłady Budowy Nadwozi Samochodowych (Automobile Chassis Works) was established. After the reconstruction of the factory the company started to develop and build car bodies for Lublin and Star trucks. The company built buses such as the Jelcz PR110D. In 1974 the Polish expedition to Lhotse used a Jelcz 316 car to travel from Warsaw to Nepal. In 1975 the expedition of the Wrocław Mountain Club to Broad Peak Central used a Jelcz 315-M car to travel from Wrocław to Islamabad driving up to 9000 km between 2–21 May. Since 2004 Jelcz Sp. z o.o. has concentrated on producing military trucks mainly for Polish Armed Forces (for example the WR-40 Langusta platform).

Founded in 1899 and apart from a five-year period from 1944 to 1949 when it was put into administration sequestre it was in private ownership until 1967 when it then became part of Citroën and subsequently acquired by Renault in 1974 and merged with Saviem into a new Renault Trucks company in 1978. The Berliet marque was phased out by 1980.   Early history[edit] A racing-model Berliet driven by Jean Porporato in the 1908 Targa Florio race Berliet 20HP Closed swing-seat tonneau 1903 Berliet 40HP Tourer 1904 Marius Berliet started his experiments with automobiles in 1894. Some single-cylinder cars were followed in 1900 by a twin-cylinder model. In 1902 Berliet took over the plant of Audibert & Lavirotte in Lyon. Berliet started to build four-cylinder automobiles featured by a honeycomb radiator and steel chassis frame was used instead of wood. The next year a model was launched that was similar to contemporary Mercedes. In 1906 Berliet sold the licence for manufacturing his model to the American Locomotive Company. Before World War I Berliet offered a range of models from 8 CV to 60 CV. The main models had four-cylinder engines (2412 cc and 4398 cc respectively) and there was a six-cylinder model of 9500 cc. A 1539 cc model (12 CV) was produced between 1910 and 1912. From 1912 six-cylinder models were made upon individual orders only.  First World War[edit] The First World War led to a massive increase in demand.[2]   Berliet like Renault and Latil produced trucks for the French army. The military orders placed major demands on the factorys capacity necessitating major investment in production plant and factory space.[2]  Berliet CBA at the Verdun Memorial museum. The CBA became the iconic truck on the Voie Sacrée supplying the battle front at Verdun during 1916. It continued in production till 1932.[3] In 1915 a 400-hectare (990-acre) site was purchased between Vénissieux and Saint-Priest in order to build a new principal factory.[4] The Berliet CBA became the iconic truck on the Voie Sacrée supplying the battle front at Verdun during 1916.[4] 25000 of these 4/5 ton Berliet trucks originally launched in 1914 were ordered by the French army. During 1916 40 of them were leaving the plant each day.   Under license from Renault Berliet were also producing shells and battle tanks at this time. The number of workers employed increased to 3150. By 1917 the value of annual turnover had multiplied fourfold since the start of the war[2] and a new legal structure was deemed appropriate. The company became the Société anonyme des Automobiles Marius Berliet.[4]  Between two wars[edit] After the war the manufacturer reoriented part of its production back to passenger cars but Berliet nevertheless found themselves with excess capacity as the army was no longer buying all the trucks the factory could produce and overall output halved.[2]  Shrinking the range[edit] Marius Berliet responded to the outbreak of peace by deciding to produce just a single type of truck and a single type of car which represented a departure from his pre-war market strategy.[5]  The single truck on which Berliet focused was the 5 ton CBA that had served the nation so well during the war.[5]  An ill-judged short-cut[edit] The passenger car to be produced exhibited on the Berliet stand at the 15th Paris Motor Show in October 1919 was the 3296cc (15HP/CV) Torpedo bodied Berliet Type VB of modern appearance.[5]   Marius Berliet was not one to miss a trick: rather than devote time and engineering talent to developing a new car for the new decade he obtained and copied an American Dodge.[5]   The Dodge was famously robust and the Berliet copy was well received in March 1919 when it had its first public outing locally at the Lyon Trade Fair.[5]   The headlights were mounted unusually high and the simple disc wheels were large giving the car a pleasing no nonsense look.[5]   Particularly attractive was the price of just 11800 francs in October 1919.[5]   Unfortunately however the Berliet engineers failed to ensure that the steel used in the cars construction was of the same quality as the North American steel used for the Dodge and this resulted in serious problems for the early customers of the Berliet Type VB and serious reputational damage to the company.[5]  Bankruptcy and recovery[edit] The factory had been set up to produce the Berliet Type VB at the rate of 100 cars per day which would have been an ambitious target under any circumstances.[2]   The rapid drop-off in demand for what at this stage was the manufacturers only passenger car model that followed the quality issues plunged the business into financial difficulties with losses of 55 million francs recorded in one year.[2]   Survival was in doubt and Berliet was placed in judicial administration in 1921.[2]   Marius Berliet himself had held 88% of the share capital but was unable to pay off all the companys creditors and the firm therefore fell into the hands of the banks.[2]   Berliet was nevertheless able to retain operational control.[2]  During the ensuring decade supported by a sustained recovery in demand that in turn reflected an effective model strategy after 1922 Berliet was able to pay off his debtors and in 1929 to regain financial control over the business from the banks.[2]  A full range for 1925[edit] By the middle of the decade the manufacturer was again exhibiting a full range of automobile models at the 1924 October Motor Show although at this stage they all featured four cylinder engines including even the 3958cc 4-litre with its impressive cylinder dimensions of 95 x 140 mm.[6]  The range for 1925 was as follows:[6]  Type VI: Launched 1924 with a 1160cc (7HP/CV) ohc engine. Wheelbase 2800 mm (110.2 in)Listed prices Oct 1924: 16260 francs (bare chassis) 21500 francs (Torpedo) 25500 francs (berline/saloon/sedan) Type VRC with a 2603cc (12 HP/CV) sidevalve engine. Wheelbase 3060 mm (120.5 in)Listed prices Oct 1924: 20600 francs (bare chassis) 26500 francs (Torpedo) 34000 francs (berline/saloon/sedan) Type VM with a 3296cc (16 HP/CV) sidevalve engine. Wheelbase 3150 mm (124.0 in)Listed prices Oct 1924: 24800 francs (bare chassis) 33000 francs (Torpedo) 41650 francs (berline/saloon/sedan) Type VRK / 2½-litre with a 2480cc (16 HP/CV) ohv engine. Wheelbase 3350 mm (131.9 in)Listed prices Oct 1924: 30000 francs (bare chassis) 46500 francs (Torpedo) 48500 francs (berline/saloon/sedan) Type VK with a 3958cc (18 HP/CV) ohv engine. Wheelbase 3585 mm (141.1 in)Listed prices Oct 1924: 48500 francs (bare chassis only) From 1925 the manufacturer was producing its own car bodies.[7]  Pushing up market[edit] New six-cylinder models followed in 1927.   By October 1928 just twelve months before the Wall Street Crash crystallized a savage downturn for the western economies three of the four cars offered for 1929 on the Berliet stand at the Paris Motor Show were powered by six cylinder engines.[8]  The range for 1929 was as follows:[8]  9CV: 1.5-litre 4-cylinder engine. Wheelbase 2800 mm (110.2 in) 10CV: 1.8-litre 6-cylinder engine. Wheelbase 2900 mm (114.2 in) 11CV: 2.0-litre 6-cylinder engine. Wheelbase 2900 mm (114.2 in) 20CV: 4.0-litre 6-cylinder engine. Wheelbase 3600 mm (141.7 in) The largest of these with its four-litre engine was still listed by the manufacturer in March 1929 but was only available to special order.[8] However by this time the manufacturer was also developing for 1930 a 16CV 2.8-litre six-cylinder model.[8]  The 1930s[edit] Berliet Dauphine 11CV (ca 1936). In 1930 Berliet experimentally installed a diesel engine in one of their old CBA trucks and in 1931 a batch of diesel powered Berliet GD2s was produced. From 1933 only four-cylinder models (1600 cc and 2000 cc) were offered. The last new Berliet sedan was first exhibited at the Paris Motor Show in October 1933 but only launched in the summer of 1934.[9]  The new car received a proper name and the Berliet Dauphine 11CV was powered by a 1990 cc (11CV) engine. For 1939 Berliet stopped producing car bodies and the last few hundred Berliet Dauphines produced in the first half of 1939 used the body of a Peugeot 402 with a custom-made Berliet hood/bonnet and radiator grille.[10]   Second World War and aftermath[edit] Berliet GLR Regular passenger car production ceased in 1939 and after World War II the company produced trucks only with buses added to the range later. However more than 20 brand-new sedans were in the factory when the Germans requisitioned it in June 1940 and these were immediately put into service. After the liberation from late 1944 to early 1945 about 50 sedans were assembled from parts on hand and in 1946 the last 15 sedans were completed by the Geneva agents. The company was given back to the family in 1949 but to Marius Berliets son Paul following the founders death earlier that year. The Berliet GLR truck became the first new post-war product. In his 1975 book Vichy France: old guard and new order: 1940-1944 Robert Paxton contrasted the fate of the Berliet truck factory in Lyon which remained in Marius Berliets family possession despite his having manufactured 2330 trucks for the Germans.[11] — and the fate of Louis Renaults factories which had also been seized — suggesting that the Renault factory might have been returned to Louis Renault and his family had he lived longer. Marius Berliet who died in 1949 had however stubbornly refused to recognize legal actions against him after the war.[11] As it happened Renaults were the only factories permanently seized by the French government.[11] After a small start with diesel engines in 1931 Berliet (and their customers) gradually abandoned petrol engines. In 1963 only 234 of the 15325 Berliet vehicles built still received petrol engines.[12] Berliet manufactured the largest truck in the world[13] in 1957 the T100 6X6 with either 600 PS (441 kW; 592 hp) and 700 PS (515 kW; 690 hp) from a Cummins V12 engine. Available as a 6WD Dumptruck or 6X6 Roadtractor for Europe and North Africa it was designed in 10 months at the factory in Courbevoie outside of Paris with a second example built in 1958 and two further T100s built in 1959. Later on a separate company called MOL Trucks of Hooglede Belgium bought the design rights of some original Berliet models of the 1970s and started to manufacture their own original MOL model range consisting of medium to large 4X4 6X6 and 8X8 lorries and roadtractors. Their design and engineering was entirely based on selected former Berliet units.  Citroën Renault and demise[edit] In August 1967 it was reported that Berliet had been taken over by Citroën Berliet share holders receiving Citroën shares in return for their Berliet stock.[14] In 1966 Berliets final year as an independent they had produced approximately 17000 units.[14] Following the take-over the merged company stated that Citroën-Berliet would command 58% of Frances market for commercial vehicles above 6 tons.[14] Citroën itself had been owned by Michelin since 1934 following a cash crisis of its own. By this time Michelin owned both Citroën and Berliet. However after the 1973 oil crisis Michelin decided to divest itself of these two companies in order to concentrate on its tire business. Thus in 1974 Berliet was sold to Renault while Citroën was sold to Peugeot. Renault then proceeded to merge Berliet with Saviem to form Renault Véhicules Industriels in 1978. After the merger the Berliet name was phased out and another French marque came to an end by the late 1970s with the last Berliet bus in production the 1971 PR100 continuing to be sold as a Renault until 1993. Other products that survived the merger include the 1973 VXB-170 4x4 armoured personnel carrier for the French Army and others. Another of Berliets last projects was a six-cylinder light diesel engine which entered production in 1977 and had become Renault V.I.s 06.20 (120 bore) engine by 1982.[15]  See also[edit] Missions Berliet-Ténéré SNVI Algerian truck manufacturer using former Berliet assets in Algeria References[edit]   ^ Berliet (Automobiles).

The Oreos 2X is among the first electric vehicles of this kind to be produced in France. Entirely electric this minibus lowers the environmental impact of transport for local authorities or private actors in need of this kind of vehicle.   Technical characteristics[edit] Maximal speed: more than 70 km/h (43 mph) Range: 120 km (75 mi)[1] Energy recovery rate (during brake or deceleration phases) : around 20% The Oreos 2X uses lithium-ion batteries which can be recharged without the use of a battery charger because this charger is included in the bus.  Equipment[edit] The Oreos 2X has been designed for the transportation of a maximum number of 22 people including 13 seated places. The bus can also be equipped with a disabled people access system.  Operation[edit] Oreos 2X are running in the public transport network of the cities of Provins (Seine-et-Marne France) operated by Procars[2] and in the city of Chevreuse (Yvelines France) operated by SAVAC.

2189791,3,100,For the IATA code KAG see Gangneung Airbase. KAG-3 in Kaunas KAG-3 in Kaunas Kauno autobusų gamykla (transl. Kaunas Bus Factory) abbreviated KAG was a factory in Kaunas Lithuanian SSR that produced about 10000 KAG-3 buses from 1956 to 1990.[1]  The buses used chassis of the GAZ-51 truck. The factory then added wooden frames covered with metal sheets. It was the only mass-produced vehicle in Lithuania.[1] The factory was established in an old workshop owned by Amerikos lietuvių akcinė bendrovė [lt] (Lithuanian American Joint Stock Company) abbreviated as Amlit. The company imported Ford cars Fordson tractors and bicycles.[2] Around 1929 it started building passenger buses with wooden frames based on Ford chassis. About 25 buses were produced per year.[3] The company was nationalised after Lithuania was occupied by the Soviet Union. After World War II there was a shortage of vehicles and metal. The auto shop then known as Kauno autoremonto gamykla started modifying ZIS-150 trucks into L-1 buses that were first designed and produced in Leningrad in 1949.[4][5] In 1952 the factory started building KAG-1 passenger buses which were copies of the Russian GZA-651 buses and were built on the GAZ-51 chassis.[5] The factory improved the model and developed its own KAG-3 bus though it retained essentially the same specifications.[4] The buses had a six-cylinder 68 horsepower 3.5-litre engines. An empty bus weighted 3890 kilograms (8580 lb).[1] KAG-3 was the most popular model with up to 350 vehicles produced per year.[5] The wooden frame would rot over time which is why only a couple buses have survived. Examples are preserved in museums in Kaunas and Vievis as well as by a classic car club in Kaunas.[1] The wooden frame could also easily catch fire in an accident. One of the largest accidents occurred in winter 1966 when a crowded bus drove into a ditch and caught fire on the road from Luokė to Smilgiai. 21 people died in the accident four others suffered severe burns.[1] Due to safety concerns the buses were phased out from passenger transport and converted into cargo or utility vehicles.[4] However the KAG buses remained in demand even after metal frame buses (such as PAZ-652) became available. The wooden frame could be replaced (some buses had 3 or 4 frame changes) and performed better on uneven roads (such as roads of the Caucasus).[4]  Models[edit] The factory produces these models:[1]  KAG-1 (19 passengers) – very similar to the Russian GZA-651 buses KAG-3 (23 seated passengers plus 7 standing passengers) KAG-31 (KAG-3 based cargo van) KAG-32 (KAG-3 based bread van) KAG-33 (KAG-3 based technical service van) KAG-34 (KAG-3 based explosive materials van) KAG-317 (KAG-3 based household service van) KAG-4 (24 passenger) – two experimental vehicles with all metal frames produced in 1959[4] KAG-41 (KAG-4 based cargo van) – one experimental vehicle with all metal frame produced in 1959[4] References[edit]   ^ a b c d e f Sviklas Paulius (11 March 2016).

Based in Arbon Switzerland the firm was active between 1903 and 1982. Their vehicles were widely used across mainland Europe particularly in the interwar period.   History[edit] 1910 Saurer Motor Trucks Ad A Saurer Car-Alpin  in 1930 In 1853 Franz Saurer (1806–1882) from Veringenstadt Germany established an iron foundry for household goods near the Swiss town of Sankt Gallen. Eastern Switzerland was a center for both embroidery and embroidery machine development. About 1850 Franz Rittmeyer built the first practical satin stitch embroidery machine known as the Handstickmaschine. Several Swiss companies began building and improving these machines and their heyday lasted from roughly 1865 until the end of the century. Two of Franz Saurers sons – Anton and Adolf - were aware of this invention saw an opportunity and began building hand embroidery machines in their fathers foundry in about 1869. By 1873 F. Saurer & Söhne was the leader among the Swiss competitors in terms of sales and total machines built. By 1883 Saurers production peaked at 796 machines per year. They had produced a total of 5530 machines to date. Saxony Germany was also a center for embroidery and machine development. By the 1890s German companies were Saurers strongest competition. By the late 1870s a new faster type of machine was invented. The (bobbin) shuttle or schiffli machine adapted the lock stitch from the sewing machine. A German company added a Jacquard punch card reader and thus fully automated the process. Competition motivated engineers at Saurer to develop their own Jacquard card reader improve the stitch rate and increase the machines width i.e. total number of needles and throughput. In 1905 Saurer matched the competing machines width at ten meters.  In 1913 it increased the width to 15 meters.[1] The embroidery industry experienced many ups and downs due to fashion trade policies and world wars. Saurer diversified into petrol and diesel engines and then trucks to reduce its exposure to this volatility. However Saurer continued to innovate and is still a leader in schiffli embroidery machines. In 1896 the eldest surviving son Adolph Saurer (1841–1920) took over the company.  He and his son Hippolyt (1878–1936) developed the enterprise as a joint-stock company.  Hippolyt Saurer initiated the production of a phaeton body automobile run by a one-cylinder opposed-piston engine. In 1902 a first four-cylinder T-head engine model with touring car and sedan chassis was built. From 1903 onwards Saurer concentrated on the production of commercial vehicles which soon gained a good reputation. The company ran subsidiary companies in Austria (1906–1959 in the end taken over by Steyr-Daimler-Puch) France (1910–1956 taken over by Unic) the United Kingdom (1927–1931 taken over by Armstrong Whitworth as Armstrong-Saurer) and in Germany (1915–1918 taken over by MAN). In Italy the Officine Meccaniche (OM) manufacturer was for many years licensee of Saurer engines and other mechanical units which they used in their own ranges of trucks and buses. In Poland the state-owned Państwowe Zakłady Inżynieryjne produced license-built Saurer engines (powering among others the 7TP and 9TP tanks) and coach chassis used in the Zawrat bus. In the United States the Saurer Motor Truck Company headed by C.P. Coleman had the rights to manufacture and sell heavy trucks under the Saurer brand name at its plant in Plainfield New Jersey (which commenced operations in November 1911). On September 23 1911 the Saurer Motor Truck Company merged with the Mack Brothers Motor Car Company of Allentown Pennsylvania headed by J. M. Mack to form the International Motor Truck Company (IMTC).[2] IMTC would continue to make and sell trucks using the Saurer name until 1918. In 1922 IMTC would become Mack Trucks Inc. Saurer trucks were developed along the years into four basic ranges:  A-type (1918) B-type (1926) C-type (1934) D-type (1959) It was the B-type that established Saurers international reputation as a builder of long-lasting trucks. In 1929 Saurer acquired its Swiss rival Motorwagenfabrik Berna AG of Olten but the Berna name was allowed to continue badging the very same Saurer models. From 1932 on trolleybuses were a very significant segment of Saurer production. Typically Saurer or Berna trolleybuses featured Brown Boveri & Cie or Société Anonyme des Ateliers de Sécheron (SAAS) electric equipment and Carrosserie Hess bodies. Saurer trolleybuses operated in most of Central Europe countries and still do in several of them. In World War 2 a restructured type BT 4500 and 5 BHw of Saurer trucks were used to gas people in the Nazi Chełmno extermination camp. Extermination vans were adapted when they went in for repair to carry the optimum number of people who could be gassed in the time it took to drive them from Chelmno to the woods where they were disposed of in ovens. There was concern about the strain on the front axle if too many people were loaded to be gassed but as piles of bodies were always closest to the doors there was no strain on the front axle.[3][4] In 1951 Saurer and its Italian licensee OM reached an agreement by which Saurer would market in Switzerland OMs light and medium-weight trucks and buses using Saurer-OM and Berna-OM badges. This was successful and lasted until Saurer closure.  Aero engines[edit] A Doflug D-3802A powered by a Saurer YS-2 aero-engine. Saurer began licensed manufacture of aero engines in 1917. They also began developing their own designs and built two prototypes of a V12 design in 1918. The FLB series developed from the 1930s to the 1940s were based on the principles of the Junkers Jumo 205. Like the Jumo they were two-stroke diesels with two crank shafts and two pistons per combustion chamber. However the cylinders were bent into a V shape allowing them to be doubled up on each crank shaft to create a compact diamond arrangement. The design was also able to run on petrol still with fuel injection and a small test engine was run in both modes. The FLB 1000 had three banks giving a design output of 1000 hp and was briefly bench-tested using petrol. However the project was dropped before it could be run on diesel. The FLB project was dropped to make room for an urgent requirement to develop the Hispano-Suiza 12Y-51 V-12 a conventional four-stroke petrol engine which was no longer available. Saurer developed it as the YS-2 which entered limited production. It was fitted to the EKW C-3604 and Doflug D-3802. The further developed YS-3 flew in the prototype Doflug D-3803.[5]  NAW[edit] Declining sales in the early 1980s saw the two leading Swiss truck makers Saurer and FBW (Franz Brozincevic & Cie of Wetzikon Switzerland) forming a joint organization called Nutzfahrzeuggesellschaft Arbon & Wetzikon proceeding with motorbus and trolleybus production under the NAW brand while the last Saurer-badged truck sold in the open market was delivered in 1983. Four years later in 1987 a model 10DM supplied to the Swiss Army meant the very last Saurer truck produced in history. In 1982 Daimler-Benz had acquired a major shareholding in NAW and soon took full control; and in a short time dropped Saurer Berna and FBW brands while using NAW premises to assemble heavy haulage versions of Mercedes-Benz trucks. Eventually NAW went into liquidation in early 2003. Last remain of the Saurer automotive activity in Arbon is the present FPT Industrial S.p.A. engine research center that up to 1990 had been the Saurer Motorenforschung Research & Development Centre.  The textile and automotive spin-offs[edit] In 1995 Ernst Thomke reputed Swiss Manager took over the leadership of Saurer AG in Arbon as chairman of the board. To restructure this conglomerate he had previously abandoned his position with its then major shareholder: BB Industrie Holding AG (22%). The previous major shareholder Tito Tettamanti of the conglomerate founded in 1853 specialized in textile machinery and propulsion technology had acquired the main competitor in each field Schlafhorst with a large manufacturing capacity excess and Ghidela. Thomke led actively Saurer AG until 1996 when he retired to the direction of the Board until 1999. In his years he promulgated transparency at all levels flexible working hours optimized the production and refined accounting systems. In 1996 the group Saurer AG went back into financial results showing profits.  More than half of the revenues originating from Schlafhorst upon its positive restructuring.  Oerlikon Textile[edit] Since 2007 the conglomerate Saurer AG which meanwhile had reached a worldwide leading status in textile machinery[citation needed] has been integrated into the Oerlikon Corporation.[6] Oerlikon-Saurer Textile is a manufacturer of systems for spinning texturizing twisting and embroidery.  Oerlikon-Saurer Graziano Trasmissioni[edit] Also since 2007 the remaining Saurer AG automative part  Graziano Trasmissioni a manufacturer of gear gear groups and complete transmission systems for agricultural earth moving and special vehicles as well as for four wheel drive passenger cars and luxury sport cars has also been integrated into the Oerlikon Corporation.[7]  Models[edit] Buses[edit] Saurer 2A Type B: 2BHP 3BHP 3BHPL (1925) Saurer AD Type C: Saurer Hess 1C (1935) Saurer Hess 2C Saurer 3C-H (1937) Saurer 4H Saurer 6H (1946) Saurer 4ZP (1946) Saurer S4C (1948) Saurer 3CT-1DA (1949) Saurer 2H Reisewagen (1952) Saurer N2C Alpenwagen II (1954) Saurer L4C Alpenwagen IIIa (1953) Type D: Saurer 3DUR Saurer 3DUX Alpenwagen (1955) Saurer 5DUP Saurer 3DUK-50 (1968-1973) Saurer 5 DUK Saurer RH (1978) Saurer RH 525-23 Postkurswagen Type IV (1978) Saurer RH 580-25 (1980) Saurer 5K (1981) Saurer SLK Trolleybus[edit] Saurer 411LM Saurer 415 Saurer GT 560 GT 560 640-25 Military Vehicles[edit] Saurer 4K 4FA Saurer MH4 Saurer M6 Nahkampfkanone 1 Nahkampfkanone 2 Saurer 2DM Saurer 10DM Saurer Tartaruga Saurer F006[edit] This article has multiple issues.

(September 2023) (Learn how and when to remove this message)   (Learn how and when to remove this message) Prototype from Monteverdi with the civil version Saurer manufactured 12 pre serial Military versions of them Saurer F006 The Saurer F006 (also known as Saurer 288) and F007 were apart from the Swiss Army cross-country trucks known as the (6-ton) Saurer 6DM and the (10-ton) Saurer 10DM the last vehicle designs of the company. In the late 1970s the F006 design from Saurer in Arbon Switzerland was intended as a successor to the Jeep for the Swiss Army. In addition it was hoped that the vehicle would also be purchased by fire departments as well as become work vehicles for community structures such as road maintenance operations forest rangers electric and water utilities etc. Selling to private users (like the Mercedes G) was not addressed but it would have been likely.  The reason was that Monteverdi the luxury car manufacturer had put on display at the Geneva Motor Show 1979 the civilian version of the Saurer F006 Military vehicle which they called the 260Z.  This was the 230th based on the Military design. The 260Z was not produced however they created three prototypes which are listed in the Monteverdi Museum in Binningen.  While Monteverdi did not use the Saurer chassis they did produce two versions of a luxury SUV vehicle called the Safari/Sahara based on the International Harvester Scout vehicle lending credence to the idea that had the F006 been in production a civilian version would have emerged. Technology: It is the Saurer F006 turned into an off-road passenger vehicle with four-wheel drive. The concept was adopted by the automaker Monteverdi improved by Berna engineering company of Olten Switzerland. Saurer took over the production. The axles are from IHC Scout (Jeep I scout from International Harvester). The vehicle had a plastic body made of polyester. For power the drive-train was a 6-cylinder petrol engine from Volvo with an automatic transmission. Maximum speed was 100 km/h. Overall styling contrasted to the Mercedes G and Puch 230GE joint venture vehicle with the front turn signals mounted conventionally on the front of the vehicle (and not on the hood). The equipment installed in the front bumper parking lights can be turned by flicking the Tarnlicht switch (a multipurpose military switch for light dimming). The basic vehicle has a fixed open back cab. The loading / passenger seats are closed with a fast mountable / demountable plastic sheet at the rear including a military holder for a gas canister; a fixed structure is provided for use in case of fire. Saurer in 1980 introduced the F006 and in 1982 it was tested by the War Technical Department of the Swiss Army which appreciated the off-road capability. However the Puch 230GE was procured instead. Failure to secure the army production order meant that production of the vehicle for other potential users was not economically viable. In the end only the 24 prototypes were built one of which remained in service until 1988 and was subsequently donated to the Saurer oldtimer club; the other remaining vehicles are privately owned. Saurer F007: Simultaneously with the Saurer F006 the Saurer F007 was introduced in 1980 as a Pinzgauer High-Mobility All-Terrain Vehicle with similar versions available to the public. The F007 uses the same chassis and the same drive unit as the F006 however unlike the F006 it does not have the cab behind the engine but instead the engine compartment is internally located (as with many vans). It is therefore called a cab. Unlike the F006 the F007 has three windshield wiper blades instead of two four headlights instead of two and the front parking lights and turn signals are housed in the same headlamp shell. The gasoline tank filler neck is on the left side immediately behind the drivers door and not as in the F006 on the right side between the rear and the rear wheel. The vehicle has a fixed cab which is open to the rear. The cargo area passenger space is covered with a plastic sheet including two plastic windows on each side. Again this was based on the concept of the cab-over model 260 F by Monteverdi. For Swiss Army procurement starting from 1982 SUVs in addition to dedicated military vehicles were prepared for testing. Here too the Swiss Army examined and appreciated the high-road tested prototypes of the F007 but did not buy the vehicle. The existing Saurer F007s are now privately owned.

5304572,3Ro,100,Italian truck The Lancia Ro Lancia Ro-Ro and Lancia 3Ro were 4x2 heavy trucks built by Italian manufacturer Lancia from the 1930s through the 1940s for military and civilian use. The 2-cylinder diesel Ro was produced from 1933 to 1939 the 3-cylinder diesel Ro-Ro from 1935 to 1939 and the improved 5-cylinder diesel 3Ro from 1938 to 1947. Ro and 3Ro saw extensive military service during the Second Italo-Ethiopian War and World War II chiefly as two of the main heavy trucks of the Royal Italian Army.

The Ro was built with two versions a three-cylinder gasoline (BM) engine or a two-cylinder diesel (Nm) engine. The Ro was particularly robust truck considered reliable requiring little maintenance and easy to drive. It was the first Italian truck to receive a 4 speed transmission.  Models[edit] Ro NM[edit] The Ro NM (for Nafta Militare or diesel military) military truck was produced in 3056 units from 1934 to 1938 and eventually replaced by the improved 3Ro.[1] Built by Lancia under license from German firm Junkers the Tipo 89 engine fitted to the Ro was a compact 3180 cc (194 cu in) four opposed-piston straight-two cylinder two-stroke diesel. It developed 64 hp (48 kW) at 1500 rpm.[1] The transmission used a Tipo 126 4-speed manual transmission with a 2 speed auxiliary for a total of 8 forward and 2 reverse speeds.[1]  Ro[edit] From 1933 to 1939 429 civilian Ro trucks were built.[1] This version differed mechanically from the military type mainly for its wider tracks front and rear as well for the availability of a longer 4250 mm (167.3 in) wheelbase alongside the  normal version.[1]  Ro BM[edit] From 1934 to 1938 Lancia built 1701 military type Ros fitted with a petrol engine intended for colonial duty—the Ro BM (364) for Benzina Militare or petrol military.[2] Its Tipo 98 petrol engine was a side valve 5120 cc (312 cu in) inline-four developing 65 hp (48 kW) at 1700 rpm.[2]  Ro-Ro[edit] The Lancia Ro-Ro (265) was an improved civilian-only longer wheelbase (4650 mm or 183.1 in) version of the Ro fitted with a Lancia-developed three cylinder version of the Lancia-Junkers two-cylinder diesel. It was built from 1935 to 1939 in 302 examples.[2] The Ro-Ro was powered by a Tipo 90 4770 cc (291 cu in) inline-three cylinders opposed piston two-stroke diesel developing 95 hp (71 kW) at 1500 rpm.[2]  Service history[edit] From 1934 to 1938 the Royal Italian Army acquired 4757 Lancia Ros which were equipped with pneumatic tires where it was used to transport artillery and light tanks. The Royal Italian Army deployed the Lancia Ro for the first time in North Africa in 1935–1936. The 228 Ros sent there gave full satisfaction to the Italian Army. Ros traveled over roads and tracks in all temperatures; and did not encounter difficulty in the mountain routes where grades can reach 25%. In Spain Ros still proved reliable on roads but its capacities over ground were very limited. The Lancia Ro was used by Royal Italian Army and Wehrmacht in World War II in all theaters of the war.

The Lancia 3 Ros design was simple functional and was considered the most reliable heavy truck of the Royal Italian Army in World War II serving in all theatres of the war. Besides the diesel military model the 3Ro was also built in civilian versions with petrol and gas engines as well as in extended wheelbase coach chassis. Production of the 3Ro chassis began in 1939 continued throughout the Second World War and finally ended in 1949 when it was superseded by the Lancia Esatau.  Specifications[edit] The 3Ro used a ladder frame and leaf spring-suspended solid axles front and rear. Powering diesel 3Ro was a Lancia Tipo 102 6875 cc (420 cu in) straight-five diesel engine with two parallel overhead valves per cylinder which developed 93 hp (69 kW) at 1860 rpm.[3] Like on the Ro the transmission used a 4-speed plus reverse gearbox complemented by a low range gearing for a total of 8 forward and 2 reverse speeds.[3] Brakes were servo-assisted mechanically operated drums on all four wheels plus hydraulic emergency hand brake also on all four wheels.[3]  Models[edit] 3Ro NM[edit] The 3Ro NM (564B) for Nafta Militare or diesel military military truck was produced in 9490 units from 1938 to 1943.[3] It was built with a 4300 mm (169.3 in) wheelbase.  3Ro[edit] The civilian 3Ro (564) truck was produced in 1307 units from 1938 to 1945.[2] Mechanically the chassis was identical to the military version. After the production of a modified civilian 3Ro began coded 564C. In total between 1936 and 1947 3336 were made.[4]  Civilian 3Ro with trailer 3Ro P and PL[edit] The 3Ro P (266P) and 3Ro PL (266PL) were stretched chassis to serve as basis for buses and coaches whose wheelbases measured respectively 4850 mm (190.9 in) and 5600 mm (220.5 in).[3] Between 1939 and 1949 837 were made.[3] In 1941 some 3Ro 266P were built with a Tipo 102C natural gas engine developed from the inline-five diesel with four valves per cylinder.[4]  3Ro BM[edit] From 1943 to 1945 a total of 408 petrol-engined 3Ro BM (564B) for Benzina Militare or petrol military were produced.[4] Like the natural gas engine the Tipo 102B inline-five petrol was derived  from the diesel with new 16-valve heads.[4]  Esaro[edit] The Lancia Esaro was a shortened version of the 3Ro produced from 1943 to 1946 in military and civilian versions with 5-cylinder petrol and diesel engines. At 3650 mm (143.7 in) the Esaros wheelbase was 650 mm (25.6 in) shorter than the military 3Ros.[5] Production amounted to 2000 of the petrol variant (made between 1943 and 1946) and just 21 diesels (all made during 1946).[5]   3Ro wartime production   Year Number   1939  657   1940  2646   1941  3162   1942  1643   1943  1205   1944  51   1945  1  Service history[edit] Over the course of the war many variants of the military 3Ro were made: troop transport supply transport 5000-litre fuel tanker 4000-litre water tanker mobile repair workshop anti-aircraft and self-propelled gun. In North Africa and Sicily with the top of the cab cut away and lower sideboards the Lancia 3 Ro became well suited for desert warfare serving as a self-propelled gun porting the Cannone da 90/53 as well as the 100/17 howitzer. German armed forces always in need of supplies and material made use of any Ro and 3Ro as well as any other equipment Italian or otherwise that came into their possession. After the Italian armistice of September 8 1943 the Wehrmacht absorbed commandeered Ro and 3Ro trucks from their former ally. In April 1944 with the Lancia factory in German controlled Italy German armed forces placed an order for 772 3Ro built between January 1944 and February 1945. After the end of the war the 3Ro remained in service in the Italian Army with the last 3Ro truck being retired in 1964.

Following the first world war the Works commenced locomotive production in a separate factory dedicated to that purpose. This factory became a separate company in the 1990s. Today Škoda Transportation develops and manufactures electric rail vehicles for urban and railway transport. Škoda Transportation fully or partially owns a number of other companies active in the field of development and manufacturing of rolling stock electric motors and related products in several European countries. In April 2018 the European Commission cleared purchase of the group by PPF a financial and investment group incorporated in the Netherlands.[4] Currently Petr Novotny is the CEO of the Škoda Transportation appointed in October 2023. Škoda Transportation group of companies is among the worlds largest manufacturers of trams and propulsion units for trolleybuses and a significant regional producer of railway vehicles.   History[edit] Škoda Works[edit] Count Waldstein established a metallurgical factory in Plzeň in 1859. Starting with 100 employees the factory made products for breweries sugar mills mines as well as steam engines and railway products. The factory was bought by its chief engineer Emil Škoda in 1869. By the end of the century Škoda Works became one of the largest enterprises in Europe focusing mainly on the production of heavy arms and heavy ship components. Apart from military production the Works were also producing a number of rolling stock components by the end of the 19th century: wheels axles hoops and steam engines. During the first world war the company started refurbishing locomotives. By 1918 the company had 35.000 employees and a debilitating debt accrued due to unpaid military deliveries to the Central Powers as well as unpaid pre-war loan that the company provided to China.[5]  Locomotive factory[edit] As a part of its shift towards non-military production the Works earmarked a portion of its facilities for manufacturing of locomotives.[6] The production started following an order for 30 locomotives for Czechoslovakia. The first Škoda locomotive left the factory on 11 June 1920. Meanwhile Škoda gained a major contract for production of 80 and refurbishment of 500 locomotives for Romania. Due to the Romanian order Škoda regained banks confidence which provided the company with financing to survive through the immediate post-war years. The locomotive factory became one of the companys main pillars.[6]   Škoda rolling stock products   1930s Škoda locomotive    1930s locomotive exported to China    1938 Class 19D in South Africa    Škoda pre-WWII tram of Belgrade Serbia now in museum    1941 Škoda 3Tr trolleybus    1949 Кч4 in Russia   The company produced its 100th locomotive on 13 September 1921. In 1927 Škoda produced its first express electric locomotive which was followed by the introduction of electric freight locomotives. While electric locomotives were used on electrified lines within Prague the company further produced electric locomotives with batteries for use within factory areas. Also in 1927 Škoda started production of diesel locomotives and diesel express trains. In the 1930s the locomotive factory was producing on average 3 locomotives a month with third of the production for export.[7] Meanwhile in another factory building situated in Plzeň Škoda started producing electrical propulsion units for trams in the early 1920s. In 1936 the company started producing the model 3Tr  6Tr 7Tr 8Tr 9Tr trolleybuses.[7] Production of locomotives as well as trolleybuses continued during the companys period of nationalization after the WW2. After fall of communism in 1989 Škoda Works were transformed into a joint stock company the assets of which were later diversified into several separate entities among them also Škoda Dopravní Technika s. r. o. which included the rolling stock factory in Plzeň and which was renamed to Škoda Transportation in 2004.[7] In the early 1990s the company started working also on refurbishment of trams which was followed by introduction of its first own tram design in 1997 the low-floor Škoda 03 T.[7]  Škoda Transportation[edit] The Czech Republic sold Škoda Transportation to private owners in 2002. While in private hands the company extended its reach by purchasing stock in other companies that are active in production and R&D of rolling stock in Europe. Today Škoda Transportation group of companies is one of the worlds largest manufacturers of trams and propulsion units for trolleybuses as well as a significant regional producer of locomotives and electric trains.

A 1951 Berna trolleybus in service in Biel/Bienne in 1979 Berna was a Swiss manufacturer of buses trolleybuses and trucks which later also specialized in surface metallurgical treatments and components. Until the 1960s it was primarily a vehicle manufacturer but between 1965 and 1978 vehicle manufacturing was phased out and replaced with other products.  The company was based in Olten.

August 1906 The company was founded in 1902 by Joseph Wyss and changed its name from Schweizerische Automobil Fabrik Berna (S.A.F.B.) to Motor-Werke Berna AG in 1906. The company initially manufactured cars and Wyss was its first car designer. Berna was also involved in the development of the Tank Nahkampfkanone 1 Bernas first car made in 1902 was the Berna Vis-à-Vis Idéal. Another model was powered by one-cylinder engines which were placed on the rear. In 1903 a new car called the Unicum was produced with the engine placed on the front and the back wheels were powered by chains.  By 1905 Berna was also building trucks/lorries.  A Berna 4 UPO autobus of 1946. In 1907 Wyss sold the company to a businessman named Locher who eventually went bankrupt.[citation needed] The company came under English control in 1908 and production of cars ceased but it was bought back by Swiss shareholders in 1912 and reorganized as Motorwagenfabrik Berna AG (Berna Motor Vehicle Factory).[1] In 1929 following a period of financial difficulties Saurer acquired majority control of Berna.[1]  Manufacturing of trucks like the Berna 2 Berna L275/10 Berna 2VM Berna 2 US and buses continued including trolleybuses starting in 1940. In 1965 Berna branched out into metallurgy with two new subsidiaries in the United States and Germany selling the metal treatment product Bernex.  Vehicle manufacturing was taken over entirely by Saurer in 1976 and Berna AG became a wholly owned subsidiary of Saurer.[1]  In 1978 the company had 650 employees and realized 55 million CHF in sales.[1]  In 1995 Berna AG had 160 employees and 45 million CHF in sales.[1]  In 2003 the Saurer Group sold the company which had gradually separated into two divisions with different specialties and the sale resulted in the establishment of two new but affiliated companies Bernex Bimetall AG and IonBond AG Olten both still sharing the same site in Olten.  Trolleybuses[edit] Production of trolleybuses lasted from 1940 to 1967 and included both two-axle and articulated vehicles.[2]  All were sold to Swiss transit systems. Although the total number made was only 131 they were purchased by seven of the countrys 15 different urban trolleybus operators[2] or approximately half of all urban Swiss trolleybus systems existing during the period.  A few 1965–66 Berna trolleybuses were still in passenger service in 2010 in Valparaíso Chile[3] whose trolleybus operating company bought them secondhand from Geneva and Schaffhausen when they were withdrawn from service there in 1992.

A 1951 Berna trolleybus in service in Biel/Bienne in 1979 Berna was a Swiss manufacturer of buses trolleybuses and trucks which later also specialized in surface metallurgical treatments and components. Until the 1960s it was primarily a vehicle manufacturer but between 1965 and 1978 vehicle manufacturing was phased out and replaced with other products.  The company was based in Olten.

August 1906 The company was founded in 1902 by Joseph Wyss and changed its name from Schweizerische Automobil Fabrik Berna (S.A.F.B.) to Motor-Werke Berna AG in 1906. The company initially manufactured cars and Wyss was its first car designer. Berna was also involved in the development of the Tank Nahkampfkanone 1 Bernas first car made in 1902 was the Berna Vis-à-Vis Idéal. Another model was powered by one-cylinder engines which were placed on the rear. In 1903 a new car called the Unicum was produced with the engine placed on the front and the back wheels were powered by chains.  By 1905 Berna was also building trucks/lorries.  A Berna 4 UPO autobus of 1946. In 1907 Wyss sold the company to a businessman named Locher who eventually went bankrupt.[citation needed] The company came under English control in 1908 and production of cars ceased but it was bought back by Swiss shareholders in 1912 and reorganized as Motorwagenfabrik Berna AG (Berna Motor Vehicle Factory).[1] In 1929 following a period of financial difficulties Saurer acquired majority control of Berna.[1]  Manufacturing of trucks like the Berna 2 Berna L275/10 Berna 2VM Berna 2 US and buses continued including trolleybuses starting in 1940. In 1965 Berna branched out into metallurgy with two new subsidiaries in the United States and Germany selling the metal treatment product Bernex.  Vehicle manufacturing was taken over entirely by Saurer in 1976 and Berna AG became a wholly owned subsidiary of Saurer.[1]  In 1978 the company had 650 employees and realized 55 million CHF in sales.[1]  In 1995 Berna AG had 160 employees and 45 million CHF in sales.[1]  In 2003 the Saurer Group sold the company which had gradually separated into two divisions with different specialties and the sale resulted in the establishment of two new but affiliated companies Bernex Bimetall AG and IonBond AG Olten both still sharing the same site in Olten.  Trolleybuses[edit] Production of trolleybuses lasted from 1940 to 1967 and included both two-axle and articulated vehicles.[2]  All were sold to Swiss transit systems. Although the total number made was only 131 they were purchased by seven of the countrys 15 different urban trolleybus operators[2] or approximately half of all urban Swiss trolleybus systems existing during the period.  A few 1965–66 Berna trolleybuses were still in passenger service in 2010 in Valparaíso Chile[3] whose trolleybus operating company bought them secondhand from Geneva and Schaffhausen when they were withdrawn from service there in 1992.

The 4-series bus range was first presented in September 1996 when the integral low-floor city bus OmniCity was revealed.[1] Production of the chassis range started in second half of 1997 and by the end of 1998 all worldwide production facilities had changed from 3-series to 4-series.[2] Unlike the 3-series which was a range of 45 different chassis models the 4-series is one basic chassis with different modular configurations depending on usage and customer needs. At launch there were a total of seven major configurations presumably the F HB K EB K IB L IB L UB N UA and N UB. These were later followed by the F HA K UB L IA L UA and N UD. The first letter describing the position of the engine and the last two letters describing areas of use. In marketing of the 4-series Scania have generally only used the engine position (F/K/L/N) the engine displacement (9/11/12) and the series number (4) which is why we know them as F94 F114 K94 K114 K124 L94 and N94. The 4-series was superseded in 2006 by the new Euro IV compliant bus and coach range consisting of the K-series N-series and F-series. Some 4-series products have been available for a couple of years after this.   Type designation breakdown[edit] Engine location F: chassis with longitudinal engine ahead of the front axle K: chassis with longitudinal engine behind rearmost axle centrally mounted L: chassis with longitudinal engine behind rearmost axle inclined 60° to the left N: chassis with transverse engine behind rearmost axle inclined 60° to the rear Engine series 9: DSC9/DC9 11: DC11 12: DSC12/DC12 Development code 4: 4-series Type of transport E: coach long distance high comfort (K chassis only) H: intercity short to long distance uneven surface (F chassis only) I: intercity short to long distance normal comfort U: urban short distance normal comfort Chassis adaption A: articulated bus B: normal bus D: double-decker bus Wheel configuration 4X2: two-axle bus 6X2: tri-axle bus 6X2/2: tri-axle articulated bus 6X2*4: tri-axle bus with steered tag axle behind drive axle 6X2/4: tri-axle bus with steered tag axle in front of drive axle (one known example see K94UB) 8X2: quad-axle bus (K IB chassis in Latin America only) Chassis height E: low front and rear (N chassis only) H: high front and rear (F chassis only) L: low front normal rear N: normal front and rear Suspension A: leaf-spring suspension front and air suspension rear (F HA chassis only) B: air suspension front and rear rigid front axle I: air suspension front and rear independent front suspension (K EB chassis only) Z: leaf-spring suspension front and rear (F chassis only) Power code Approximation of the power rating in hp to the nearest ten.[citation needed]  Engines[edit] Engines available at launch were the 9.0-litre (8974 cc) DSC9 and the 11.7-litre (11705 cc) DSC12 both being Euro II compliant inline 6-cylinder turbocharged and intercooled engines. The DSC9 with outputs at 220 hp (1005 Nm) 260 hp (1180 Nm) and 310 hp (1355 Nm) and the DSC12 with outputs at 360 hp (1665 Nm) and 420 hp (1950 Nm).[3] In November 1999[4] Scania presented a new range of Euro III compliant truck engines which soon became available on the buses too. The DSC9 and the DSC12 were renamed DC9 and DC12 and new power outputs were 230 hp (1100 Nm) 260 hp (1250 Nm) and 300 hp (1400 Nm) for the DC9 and 420 hp (2000 Nm) for the DC12. To fill the gap between them they were joined by the new 10.6-litre (10641 cc) DC11 engine with power outputs at 340 hp (1600 Nm) and 380 hp (1800 Nm). The 9.0-litre engine was also available with alternative fuels. The OSC9 G01 CNG engine had ratings of 260 hp (970 Nm) which was later tuned up to 990 Nm. It was later replaced by the OC9 with power outputs of 260 hp (1100 Nm) and 300 hp (1250 Nm). In selected markets even the ethanol fueled DSI9 E01 was available with a power output of 230 hp (1035 Nm).   Scania F94/F114[edit] Marcopolo Torino GV bodied Scania F94HB in Brazil The F94 and F114 were the front-engined chassis replacing the F93 and F113 of the 3-series. They were mainly produced in São Bernardo do Campo Brazil and Tucumán Argentina[5] for the Latin American and African market.  Scania F94HA[edit] The F94HA (F94HA6x2NA) was an articulated chassis with remotely mounted Voith gearbox leaf-spring suspension on the front axle and air suspension on both drive (2nd axle) and trailer axle (3rd axle). It is known as a puller artic where no hydraulic articulation control is needed.   Scania F94HB/F114HB[edit] The F94HB was a two-axle chassis with leaf-spring suspension. It was available with both normal chassis height (F94HB4x2NZ) and a higher version (F94HB4x2HZ). In Africa it was also available as the Scania F114 with a bigger engine.   Scania K94/K114/K124[edit] 2007 K124EB with Kiwi Bus Builders body at Rotorua in 2013 on Wellington to Auckland InterCity 601km route The K94 K114 and K124 were fitted with a longitudinally rear-mounted engine replacing the K93 and K113 of the 3-series. Initially only available as K94 and K124 the K114 became available in 2000. It could be built as a premium coach (K EB) a coach or intercity bus (K IB) or as a much rarer city bus version (K UB).   Scania K94EB/K114EB/K124EB[edit] The K94EB K114EB and K124EB were the only 4-series chassis with independent front suspension being the primary choice for premium coaches. They were available as two-axle (4x2) tri-axle (6x2) and tri-axle with steered tag axle (6x2*4). A normal tri-axle coach would have the full designation of K124EB6x2NI but because of the independent front suspension it was also available as K124EB6x2LI with low front which made it possible to have a gangway between the front wheel arches and a low driving position making it suitable for use in double-decker coaches.   Scania K94IB/K114IB/K124IB[edit] Scania K124IB bus manufactured in 2000 with Marcopolo Paradiso body in the colours of Brazilian bus company São Geraldo in the state of Minas Gerais Brazil The K94IB K114IB and K124IB were the standard coach and intercity bus chassis with a rigid front axle. Like the K EB type they were available as two-axle (4x2) tri-axle (6x2) and tri-axle with steered tag axle (6x2*4) and on the Latin American market also as quad-axle (8x2). The K94IB was quite rare as it was in may ways in direct competition with the L94IB as an intercity bus.  Scania K94UB[edit] A Volgren CR228L bodied Scania K94UB in service with Westbus at Sydney Olympic Park A Volgren CR224LD bodied Scania K94UB double-decker in service with Citybus at Sheung Wan Hong Kong The K94UB was a citybus chassis which allowed low floor at the front half of the bus and a step up to the rear part known in the bus industry as low-entry. One example of a tri-axle K94UB (K94UB6x2/4LB) was produced in 2000. In Hong Kong the K94UB has been fitted with a Volgren CR224LD 12m double-deck bodywork and was in operation with Citybus in Hong Kong. It is equipped with a 260 hp Euro III engine and a hydraulically (ZF - RAS) steered tag axle in front of the drive axle.[6] It was retired on 3 July 2019. Westbus (Sydney) Australia received a batch of Volgren CR228L bodied K94UB with Brazilian-made chassis.  Scania L94[edit] DZ2919 an Irizar InterCentury II-bodied Scania L94IB owned by Pak Shing Travel of Hong Kong. The L94-series was a longitudinal inclined rear-engined simple coach intercity and city bus series and was a direct replacement for the L113. It has been used widely in Scandinavia the United Kingdom Brazil and Australia. In Ireland and Northern Ireland it was also quite popular with companies such as Bus Éireann Ulsterbus and Metro. When Scania presented the successor to the 4-series the inclined engine was dropped so the L94 was superseded by the K-series.  Scania L94IA[edit] The L94IA (L94IA6x2/2NB) was an articulated normal-floor intercity bus chassis and was only available in Latin America.  Scania L94IB[edit] The L94IB was the general intercity bus and simple coach chassis. It was most common as a two-axle (L94IB4x2NB) but was also available as a tri-axle (L94IB6x2NB L94IB6x2*4NB). The L94IB was the basis for the first generation of the OmniLine integral intercity bus available in some left-hand drive markets.  Scania L94UA[edit] A Volgren CR228L bodied Scania L94UA CNG artic operated by Transperth The L94UA (L94UA6x2/2LB) was an articulated low entry city bus chassis which had low floor in the front part of the bus and then a step up to the rear part. It was available from around 2001 as an alternative to the full low-floor N94UA and was also the basis for the first generation of the articulated version of the OmniLink integral citybus.  Scania L94UB[edit] The L94UB was the versatile citybus chassis when a full low floor was not required as it like the L94UA was a low-entry configuration. Available both as two-axle (L94UB4x2LB) and tri-axle (L94UB6x2LB L94UB6x2*4LB). It was also the basis for the first generation of OmniLink which was launched in 1998.  Scania N94[edit] Nottingham City Transport Scania N94UB with OmniTown bodywork A Scania N94UD with OmniDekka bodywork owned by Reading Transport The N94 had a transverse-mounted engine and a full low floor and was a direct replacement of the N113.  Scania N94UA[edit] The N94UA (N94UA6x2/2EB) articulated chassis had a low floor throughout the length of the bus compared to the L94UA which had a step up. It was the basis for the articulated version of the OmniCity being available on left-hand drive markets from 1997.  Scania N94UB[edit] The N94UB (N94UB4x2EB) rigid two-axle chassis was first introduced as the basis for the integral OmniCity citbus in 1996 but was also available for bodywork by other manufacturers from 1997. Having a full low floor it did not sell as well as the L94UB in the Nordic countries where the low-entry alternative was more popular.  Scania N94UD[edit] The N94UD (N94UD4x2EB) double-decker chassis became available in 2002 and was mainly built for the United Kingdom and initially it was only available with East Lancs bodywork and sold as the OmniDekka the first bus was built for Metrobus and delivered in early 2003.[7] In 2005 Scania unveiled the double-deck OmniCity DD based on the N94UD. Plans for Wrightbus bodywork on the N94UD chassis were dropped after Wrightbus experienced difficulty adapting the bodywork for the chassis.

History and development[edit] passenger compartment Construction of the first wagons started in 1961. The construction comes from the Ramseier & Jenzer + Cie. In 1963 ZVB had more than ten APE 4.80 passenger trailers. In the Zugerland transport companies ZVB  (German: Zugerland Verkehrsbetrieben) the APE 4.80 were mainly used on the mountain lines Zug-Ägeri (line 1) and Zug-Menzingen (line 2) with Saurer 5 DUK buses. This first batch of APE 4.80 passenger trailers got the same blue color like the Saurer DUK 5 busses. Around 1975/76 together with the orange-colored FBW buses (manufacturer designation FBW 91U EU4A) eight  new trailers were also produced and delivered in orange color. All APE 4.80 have a trailer coupling which can be used to mount single-axle or two-axle luggage trailers AGP 3. All  APE 4.80. were designed in such a way that the entrance room at the rear also functioned as a luggage compartment these were separated from the passenger compartment by sliding doors. In the first tranche the passenger compartment was also divided into a smoking and non-smoking section by means of an intermediate wall with a door; in the second tranche the last eight APE 4.80 they were designed both as a non-smoking compartment. Both compartments were equipped with light brown leather seats.  APE 4.80  number 28 (ex. Number 3) of the ZVB is located in the Zug depot technology history (German: Zuger Depot Technikgeschichte).

Based in Arbon Switzerland the firm was active between 1903 and 1982. Their vehicles were widely used across mainland Europe particularly in the interwar period.   History[edit] 1910 Saurer Motor Trucks Ad A Saurer Car-Alpin  in 1930 In 1853 Franz Saurer (1806–1882) from Veringenstadt Germany established an iron foundry for household goods near the Swiss town of Sankt Gallen. Eastern Switzerland was a center for both embroidery and embroidery machine development. About 1850 Franz Rittmeyer built the first practical satin stitch embroidery machine known as the Handstickmaschine. Several Swiss companies began building and improving these machines and their heyday lasted from roughly 1865 until the end of the century. Two of Franz Saurers sons – Anton and Adolf - were aware of this invention saw an opportunity and began building hand embroidery machines in their fathers foundry in about 1869. By 1873 F. Saurer & Söhne was the leader among the Swiss competitors in terms of sales and total machines built. By 1883 Saurers production peaked at 796 machines per year. They had produced a total of 5530 machines to date. Saxony Germany was also a center for embroidery and machine development. By the 1890s German companies were Saurers strongest competition. By the late 1870s a new faster type of machine was invented. The (bobbin) shuttle or schiffli machine adapted the lock stitch from the sewing machine. A German company added a Jacquard punch card reader and thus fully automated the process. Competition motivated engineers at Saurer to develop their own Jacquard card reader improve the stitch rate and increase the machines width i.e. total number of needles and throughput. In 1905 Saurer matched the competing machines width at ten meters.  In 1913 it increased the width to 15 meters.[1] The embroidery industry experienced many ups and downs due to fashion trade policies and world wars. Saurer diversified into petrol and diesel engines and then trucks to reduce its exposure to this volatility. However Saurer continued to innovate and is still a leader in schiffli embroidery machines. In 1896 the eldest surviving son Adolph Saurer (1841–1920) took over the company.  He and his son Hippolyt (1878–1936) developed the enterprise as a joint-stock company.  Hippolyt Saurer initiated the production of a phaeton body automobile run by a one-cylinder opposed-piston engine. In 1902 a first four-cylinder T-head engine model with touring car and sedan chassis was built. From 1903 onwards Saurer concentrated on the production of commercial vehicles which soon gained a good reputation. The company ran subsidiary companies in Austria (1906–1959 in the end taken over by Steyr-Daimler-Puch) France (1910–1956 taken over by Unic) the United Kingdom (1927–1931 taken over by Armstrong Whitworth as Armstrong-Saurer) and in Germany (1915–1918 taken over by MAN). In Italy the Officine Meccaniche (OM) manufacturer was for many years licensee of Saurer engines and other mechanical units which they used in their own ranges of trucks and buses. In Poland the state-owned Państwowe Zakłady Inżynieryjne produced license-built Saurer engines (powering among others the 7TP and 9TP tanks) and coach chassis used in the Zawrat bus. In the United States the Saurer Motor Truck Company headed by C.P. Coleman had the rights to manufacture and sell heavy trucks under the Saurer brand name at its plant in Plainfield New Jersey (which commenced operations in November 1911). On September 23 1911 the Saurer Motor Truck Company merged with the Mack Brothers Motor Car Company of Allentown Pennsylvania headed by J. M. Mack to form the International Motor Truck Company (IMTC).[2] IMTC would continue to make and sell trucks using the Saurer name until 1918. In 1922 IMTC would become Mack Trucks Inc. Saurer trucks were developed along the years into four basic ranges:  A-type (1918) B-type (1926) C-type (1934) D-type (1959) It was the B-type that established Saurers international reputation as a builder of long-lasting trucks. In 1929 Saurer acquired its Swiss rival Motorwagenfabrik Berna AG of Olten but the Berna name was allowed to continue badging the very same Saurer models. From 1932 on trolleybuses were a very significant segment of Saurer production. Typically Saurer or Berna trolleybuses featured Brown Boveri & Cie or Société Anonyme des Ateliers de Sécheron (SAAS) electric equipment and Carrosserie Hess bodies. Saurer trolleybuses operated in most of Central Europe countries and still do in several of them. In World War 2 a restructured type BT 4500 and 5 BHw of Saurer trucks were used to gas people in the Nazi Chełmno extermination camp. Extermination vans were adapted when they went in for repair to carry the optimum number of people who could be gassed in the time it took to drive them from Chelmno to the woods where they were disposed of in ovens. There was concern about the strain on the front axle if too many people were loaded to be gassed but as piles of bodies were always closest to the doors there was no strain on the front axle.[3][4] In 1951 Saurer and its Italian licensee OM reached an agreement by which Saurer would market in Switzerland OMs light and medium-weight trucks and buses using Saurer-OM and Berna-OM badges. This was successful and lasted until Saurer closure.  Aero engines[edit] A Doflug D-3802A powered by a Saurer YS-2 aero-engine. Saurer began licensed manufacture of aero engines in 1917. They also began developing their own designs and built two prototypes of a V12 design in 1918. The FLB series developed from the 1930s to the 1940s were based on the principles of the Junkers Jumo 205. Like the Jumo they were two-stroke diesels with two crank shafts and two pistons per combustion chamber. However the cylinders were bent into a V shape allowing them to be doubled up on each crank shaft to create a compact diamond arrangement. The design was also able to run on petrol still with fuel injection and a small test engine was run in both modes. The FLB 1000 had three banks giving a design output of 1000 hp and was briefly bench-tested using petrol. However the project was dropped before it could be run on diesel. The FLB project was dropped to make room for an urgent requirement to develop the Hispano-Suiza 12Y-51 V-12 a conventional four-stroke petrol engine which was no longer available. Saurer developed it as the YS-2 which entered limited production. It was fitted to the EKW C-3604 and Doflug D-3802. The further developed YS-3 flew in the prototype Doflug D-3803.[5]  NAW[edit] Declining sales in the early 1980s saw the two leading Swiss truck makers Saurer and FBW (Franz Brozincevic & Cie of Wetzikon Switzerland) forming a joint organization called Nutzfahrzeuggesellschaft Arbon & Wetzikon proceeding with motorbus and trolleybus production under the NAW brand while the last Saurer-badged truck sold in the open market was delivered in 1983. Four years later in 1987 a model 10DM supplied to the Swiss Army meant the very last Saurer truck produced in history. In 1982 Daimler-Benz had acquired a major shareholding in NAW and soon took full control; and in a short time dropped Saurer Berna and FBW brands while using NAW premises to assemble heavy haulage versions of Mercedes-Benz trucks. Eventually NAW went into liquidation in early 2003. Last remain of the Saurer automotive activity in Arbon is the present FPT Industrial S.p.A. engine research center that up to 1990 had been the Saurer Motorenforschung Research & Development Centre.  The textile and automotive spin-offs[edit] In 1995 Ernst Thomke reputed Swiss Manager took over the leadership of Saurer AG in Arbon as chairman of the board. To restructure this conglomerate he had previously abandoned his position with its then major shareholder: BB Industrie Holding AG (22%). The previous major shareholder Tito Tettamanti of the conglomerate founded in 1853 specialized in textile machinery and propulsion technology had acquired the main competitor in each field Schlafhorst with a large manufacturing capacity excess and Ghidela. Thomke led actively Saurer AG until 1996 when he retired to the direction of the Board until 1999. In his years he promulgated transparency at all levels flexible working hours optimized the production and refined accounting systems. In 1996 the group Saurer AG went back into financial results showing profits.  More than half of the revenues originating from Schlafhorst upon its positive restructuring.  Oerlikon Textile[edit] Since 2007 the conglomerate Saurer AG which meanwhile had reached a worldwide leading status in textile machinery[citation needed] has been integrated into the Oerlikon Corporation.[6] Oerlikon-Saurer Textile is a manufacturer of systems for spinning texturizing twisting and embroidery.  Oerlikon-Saurer Graziano Trasmissioni[edit] Also since 2007 the remaining Saurer AG automative part  Graziano Trasmissioni a manufacturer of gear gear groups and complete transmission systems for agricultural earth moving and special vehicles as well as for four wheel drive passenger cars and luxury sport cars has also been integrated into the Oerlikon Corporation.[7]  Models[edit] Buses[edit] Saurer 2A Type B: 2BHP 3BHP 3BHPL (1925) Saurer AD Type C: Saurer Hess 1C (1935) Saurer Hess 2C Saurer 3C-H (1937) Saurer 4H Saurer 6H (1946) Saurer 4ZP (1946) Saurer S4C (1948) Saurer 3CT-1DA (1949) Saurer 2H Reisewagen (1952) Saurer N2C Alpenwagen II (1954) Saurer L4C Alpenwagen IIIa (1953) Type D: Saurer 3DUR Saurer 3DUX Alpenwagen (1955) Saurer 5DUP Saurer 3DUK-50 (1968-1973) Saurer 5 DUK Saurer RH (1978) Saurer RH 525-23 Postkurswagen Type IV (1978) Saurer RH 580-25 (1980) Saurer 5K (1981) Saurer SLK Trolleybus[edit] Saurer 411LM Saurer 415 Saurer GT 560 GT 560 640-25 Military Vehicles[edit] Saurer 4K 4FA Saurer MH4 Saurer M6 Nahkampfkanone 1 Nahkampfkanone 2 Saurer 2DM Saurer 10DM Saurer Tartaruga Saurer F006[edit] This article has multiple issues.

(September 2023) (Learn how and when to remove this message)   (Learn how and when to remove this message) Prototype from Monteverdi with the civil version Saurer manufactured 12 pre serial Military versions of them Saurer F006 The Saurer F006 (also known as Saurer 288) and F007 were apart from the Swiss Army cross-country trucks known as the (6-ton) Saurer 6DM and the (10-ton) Saurer 10DM the last vehicle designs of the company. In the late 1970s the F006 design from Saurer in Arbon Switzerland was intended as a successor to the Jeep for the Swiss Army. In addition it was hoped that the vehicle would also be purchased by fire departments as well as become work vehicles for community structures such as road maintenance operations forest rangers electric and water utilities etc. Selling to private users (like the Mercedes G) was not addressed but it would have been likely.  The reason was that Monteverdi the luxury car manufacturer had put on display at the Geneva Motor Show 1979 the civilian version of the Saurer F006 Military vehicle which they called the 260Z.  This was the 230th based on the Military design. The 260Z was not produced however they created three prototypes which are listed in the Monteverdi Museum in Binningen.  While Monteverdi did not use the Saurer chassis they did produce two versions of a luxury SUV vehicle called the Safari/Sahara based on the International Harvester Scout vehicle lending credence to the idea that had the F006 been in production a civilian version would have emerged. Technology: It is the Saurer F006 turned into an off-road passenger vehicle with four-wheel drive. The concept was adopted by the automaker Monteverdi improved by Berna engineering company of Olten Switzerland. Saurer took over the production. The axles are from IHC Scout (Jeep I scout from International Harvester). The vehicle had a plastic body made of polyester. For power the drive-train was a 6-cylinder petrol engine from Volvo with an automatic transmission. Maximum speed was 100 km/h. Overall styling contrasted to the Mercedes G and Puch 230GE joint venture vehicle with the front turn signals mounted conventionally on the front of the vehicle (and not on the hood). The equipment installed in the front bumper parking lights can be turned by flicking the Tarnlicht switch (a multipurpose military switch for light dimming). The basic vehicle has a fixed open back cab. The loading / passenger seats are closed with a fast mountable / demountable plastic sheet at the rear including a military holder for a gas canister; a fixed structure is provided for use in case of fire. Saurer in 1980 introduced the F006 and in 1982 it was tested by the War Technical Department of the Swiss Army which appreciated the off-road capability. However the Puch 230GE was procured instead. Failure to secure the army production order meant that production of the vehicle for other potential users was not economically viable. In the end only the 24 prototypes were built one of which remained in service until 1988 and was subsequently donated to the Saurer oldtimer club; the other remaining vehicles are privately owned. Saurer F007: Simultaneously with the Saurer F006 the Saurer F007 was introduced in 1980 as a Pinzgauer High-Mobility All-Terrain Vehicle with similar versions available to the public. The F007 uses the same chassis and the same drive unit as the F006 however unlike the F006 it does not have the cab behind the engine but instead the engine compartment is internally located (as with many vans). It is therefore called a cab. Unlike the F006 the F007 has three windshield wiper blades instead of two four headlights instead of two and the front parking lights and turn signals are housed in the same headlamp shell. The gasoline tank filler neck is on the left side immediately behind the drivers door and not as in the F006 on the right side between the rear and the rear wheel. The vehicle has a fixed cab which is open to the rear. The cargo area passenger space is covered with a plastic sheet including two plastic windows on each side. Again this was based on the concept of the cab-over model 260 F by Monteverdi. For Swiss Army procurement starting from 1982 SUVs in addition to dedicated military vehicles were prepared for testing. Here too the Swiss Army examined and appreciated the high-road tested prototypes of the F007 but did not buy the vehicle. The existing Saurer F007s are now privately owned.

Made for the operating of some urban regular lines or also a private usage (for example airport shuttles) the Oreos 4X is among the first entirely electric autobuses produced in France. This clean vehicle belongs to a new generation more efficient for the power than the older models and therefore helps to reduce the environmental impact of the transport in the cities.   Technical characteristics[edit] Maximal speed : more than 70 km/h (43 mph) Range : 120 km (75 mi) Energy recovery rate (during brake or deceleration phases) : around 20% The Oreos 4X uses lithium-ion batteries which can be recharged without the use of a separate battery charger as a charger is included in the bus.  Equipment[edit] The Oreos 4X has been designed for the transportation of a maximum number of 49 people including 25 seated places. The bus can also be equipped with a disabled people access system.  Operation[edit] The city of Coulommiers (Seine-et-Marne) through Transdev currently operates some Oreos 4X.
